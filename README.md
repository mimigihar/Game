1. Create a new directory for your game.
2. Inside the directory, create a file named `guess_the_number.py`.
3. Add the following code to `guess_the_number.py`:

```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    print("Welcome to 'Guess the Number'!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))
            attempts += 1

            if guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Your guess is too low.")
            elif guess > number_to_guess:
                print("Your guess is too high.")
            else:
                print(f"Good job! You guessed my number in {attempts} attempts!")
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid integer.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_the_number()
```

4. Create a `README.md` file in the same directory with the following content:

```markdown
# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the game using Python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-number.git
cd guess-the-number
python guess_the_number.py
```

## Example

```
Welcome to 'Guess the Number'!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: 50
Your guess is too high.
Take a guess: 25
Your guess is too low.
Take a guess: 37
Good job! You guessed my number in 3 attempts!
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
```

5. (Optional) Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

6. Initialize a git repository, add your files, and push to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-number.git
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username. This will create a simple, functional game that you can share on GitHub. If you need further assistance or customization, feel free to ask!
